## What is this and what it does: 

This is a simple python script that looks for a bright red color on the screen and then does the things it says in the code so the character in the game walks to it.

I recommend using those settings: 1920x1080 display size, 3rd perso view: 2

## !!!THE SCRIPT ITS NOT GOING TO WORK WELL IF:
1. its sunny outside, the script works at night!!!
2. your characther wears a bright red or yellow colored clothes.
3. you use /fps that turns the sky yellow.
4. you use graphics mods that can alterate with the script color detection.
5. you move the .exe somewhere else. )

I'm still trying to improve the code, this has been tested in FiveM in a server named pro4kings.
I do NOT guarantee that its gonna work 100% accurate. Fivem isn't going to detect the script bc they don't touch with eachother. Use it at ur own risk!


## HOW TO RUN:

### Windows10/11:

1. Search and install Python3.12(or latest) from Microsoft Store or from the main python website.
2. Download the .zip: <a href="https://github.com/p0rtwalker/Auto-Checkpoint-FiveM/releases/download/Auto-Checkpoint-FiveM/Auto-Checkpoint-FiveM.zip" style="background-color:#28a745;color:white;padding:15px 30px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold;border-radius:8px;display:inline-block;font-size:18px;" target="_blank">Auto-Checkpoint-FiveM.zip</a>
3. Extract/Unzip the Auto-Checkpoint-FiveM.zip and open the folder.
4. Click on install-requirements.bat once and wait for the dependencies to install.
5. You can now run the script by clicking on FiveM-Checkpoint-Hunter.exe (if you trust the .exe) or by right clicking the main.py and opening it with python. If you don't have the option to open it with python, you may not have python installed or if you do, try the a b steps.
   

a. Right click in the folder and press open in terminal or try navigating in the folder in cmd...terminal...powe...uhhh whatever figure it out.  
b. Copy & paste then press enter: python3 main.py

### Linux & others: You already know.

Video of it working: comming soon
